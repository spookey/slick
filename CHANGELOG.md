## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Updated `@rollup/plugin-typescript`, `autoprefixer`, `cssnano`,
  `postcss-discard-comments`, `postcss-import`, `rollup`,
  `tslib`, `typescript` and inner dependencies.

## [v0.5.0] - 2024-10-20

### Added

- Allow usage of `.Params` in main and footer menus.
- Allow usages of `.Pre` & `.Post` in main, meta and footer menus.

### Changed

- Draw author information from `.Params.Author` instead of `.Author`.
  (Please adjust your configuration accordingly!)
- Update example page configuration for new `.pagination` setting.
- Updated `@rollup/plugin-typescript`, `del-cli`, `autoprefixer`, `cssnano`,
  `postcss-discard-comments`, `postcss-import`, `postcss`, `rollup`, `tslib`,
  `typescript` and inner dependencies.

### Fixed

- Add missing XML declaration in rss feeds (`<?xml â€¦ ?>`).

### Removed

- Drop inclusion of `.Params.css` setting, but add examples in `head.html`
  partial

## [v0.4.6] - 2024-01-29

### Added

- Missing is-active detection in footer menu.
- Ability to freely influence the output order of pages.
  Use `orderPageParam` & `orderPageReverse` to specify any combination.
  Default is like `.byDate.Reversed`. (Followup from [v0.4.4] & [v0.4.5]).
- Deprecation notice when using `.Site.Params.css`.
  Use the `head.html` partial to add arbitrary stuff to the `<head/>`
  of the page!

### Changed

- Reflect changed branch name in `README.md`.
- Explicitly order menus (header & footer) by weight.
- Determine pages to display on main index via `section` instead of `type`.

### Fixed

- Duplicated headline `README.md`.
- Restore is-active detection in menus.
  This can only be done via configuration (examples were adjusted).
  tldr; replace `url` with `pageref` and see the comments of this
  [issue](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/9150#issuecomment-965798975)
  for more details.
- Only add `author` meta tag if site author is configured.

## [v0.4.5] - 2024-01-21

### Added

- Missing `integrity` parameters for (both built in and custom) CSS files
  and the favicon.
- Add `crossorigin` parameters for all CSS & JS files.

### Changed

- Bump typescript compilation target from `ES3` to `es6`
  (should have done this years ago ^^).
- Updated `rollup` and inner dependencies.
- Code to render RSS link in the footer is more resilient now.

### Fixed

- Explicitly order pages in lists and RSS feed by date
  (Followup from [v0.4.4]).
- Wrong escaping inside `integrity` parameters for CSS and JS files.
- Also adjust all places where wrong escaping issues could occur
  (`atom:link` w. rel="self" in RSS feed; links to RSS feeds; link to favicon).

### Removed

- Drop ability to have footer links without `url`.
  They make no sense, and worse look ugly.
- Ability to load custom css files or favicons from the `static` folder.
  Only `assets` folder is supported as it supports pipes with fingerprinting.
- Drop `url` to hugo page in RSS feed `generator` tag
  (unifies with `hugo.Generator` output).

## [v0.4.4] - 2024-01-18

### Changed

- Updated `@rollup/plugin-terser`, `@rollup/plugin-typescript`, `autoprefixer`,
  `cssnano`, `del-cli`, `postcss-discard-comments`, `postcss-import`, `rollup`,
  `source-serif`, `tslib`, `typescript` and inner dependencies.

### Fixed

- Adjust minimal version in `theme.toml`.
- Explicitly order pages by date on main page.
  Thanks [@fami-com](https://github.com/fami-com) for the hint.

## [v0.4.3] - 2023-01-05

### Added

- Provide some global `centered` css helper class to be used in custom
  partials and/or shortcodes.
- Newer screenshots.

### Changed

- Overwrite `text-transform: uppercase` statement in main menu heading.
  This is some style decision from `purecss` itself. But we assemble
  navigation differently (two separate ones), so it's not required.
- Add some space to definition list styling.
- Center main menu items on small viewports, where other menu items
  stay horizontal in this case.

### Fixed

- Overall width of menus is now consistent.
- Menus and their items do not overflow anymore.

### Removed

- Remove logic to toggle styling of navigation depending on viewport
  from javascript. This is now done via css via `@media` queries.
- Drop `pull-start` and `pull-end` css helpers.

## [v0.4.2] - 2023-01-01

### Added

- Example configuration on how to adjust creation of `sitemap.xml`.
- Some template to create `robots.txt`. Include all pages, but disallows
  the taxonomy list pages.

### Changed

- Updated `@rollup/plugin-terser`, `rollup` and inner dependencies.

### Fixed

- Turn chained filters (using `|`) into explicit function calls.

### Removed

- Drop `preserveTaxonomyNames` configuration from example pages as this
  setting was removed in Hugo 0.55.

## [v0.4.1] - 2022-12-19

### Changed

  `@rollup/plugin-terser` and latest `rollup` (v3).

## [v0.4.0] - 2022-10-09

- Introduced `showRssLink` setting to control display of RSS link
  in the footer.
  Thanks [@ivan3bx](https://github.com/ivan3bx) for the idea.
- `partials/head.html` - It may be overwritten to place any content into
  the `<head/>` of the build output.

### Changed

- Updated `purecss`, `@rollup/plugin-typescript`, `autoprefixer`, `cssnano`,
  `del-cli`, `postcss-discard-comments`, `postcss-import`, `rollup`, `tslib`,
  `typescript` and inner dependencies.

## [v0.3.9] - 2022-01-29

### Added

- `.hugo_build.lock` of example sites to `.gitignore`.

### Changed

- Updated `@rollup/plugin-typescript`, `autoprefixer`, `cssnano`,
  `postcss-discard-comments`, `rollup`, `rollup-plugin-postcss`,
  `typescript` and inner dependencies.

## [v0.3.8] - 2021-10-02

## [v0.3.7] - 2021-09-14

### Changed

- Switched back to stable version of `source-code-pro` again as it has been
  released upstream (Introduced in [v0.3.3]).
- Updated `autoprefixer`, `cssnano`, `del-cli`, `rollup`,
  `@rollup/plugin-typescript`, `rollup-plugin-postcss`, `source-sans-pro`,
  `tslib`, `typescript` and inner dependencies.

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate key inside `tsconfig.json`.

## [v0.3.6] - 2021-07-05

### Changed

- Increased speed of *Scroll to top* by a factor of four.
  Scrolling on very long pages takes forever, so fix that.
- Only add `pure-img` & `pure-table` CSS classes to existing list instead of
  replacing them completely. This allows more flexible customization either
  inplace or through the `custom.css`.
- Updated `rollup`, `typescript` and inner dependencies.

## [v0.3.5] - 2021-06-20

### Added

- Added setting `showMeta` which allows hiding the title, date and meta info
  of posts in single view.

  and inner dependencies.

## [v0.3.3] - 2021-01-10

### Changed

- Updated `autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `postcss-import`, `rollup`,
  `rollup-plugin-postcss`, `typescript`, `tslib` and inner dependencies.
- Changed all paths inside `rollup.config.js` to be absolute. This reflects
  new API from *postcss* and avoids trouble when building from other contexts.

### Fixed

- Fixed now deprecated contentLanguage configuration values in the examples
- Switched the node package of `source-code-pro` to use the source of the
  `release` branch. This finally fixes black text on black background issue.
  The culprit was a SVG table with colored glyphs in them
  ([original bug](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/issues/250)).
  Now code samples can be read again.

## [v0.3.2] - 2020-06-06

## [v0.3.0] - 2019-11-26

### Added

  (Custom stylesheets can now be placed under `assets` to
  fingerprint them as well).

  Prevents missplaced subtitle when no site navigation is configured.

## [v0.2.1] - 2019-03-28

  if there is not enough content to paginate if set to `false`.
  Tanks [@mattt-b](https://github.com/mattt-b) for the idea & subtle hint.
- Added setting `showMetaDates` which allows hiding the date field of posts.

- Introduced new `menu.meta` navigation settings &rarr; meta info links for
  posts are now freely configurable: Names and URLs can be changed, Titles may

  Tanks [@mattt-b](https://github.com/mattt-b) for the idea & subtle hint.
- Added meta links to taxonomy RSS feeds in the html header.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Cleaned up some minor parts (mostly whitespace and formatting issues).
- Adjusted line below header to relate to the new `header` class.
- Ensured that an empty navigation does not draw an empty
  `navigation-content` container.
  &rarr; This allows a site to be completely without any navigation, only one
  of both, or all of them.
- Added a `clearfix` CSS rule to prevent display issues with sites that only
  use a subtitle as `navigation`.
